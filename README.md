# Pop It Solver

This is my first time using vue.js, so this won't be too complicated. I'm trying to make a pop it game "solver" for this project.

## Goal

If you didn't know, pop it is a pretty popular toy among kids, looking something like this:

And the general rule is:
 - All the "pop"s are divided into rows(there should be a visible gap thingy on each toy dividing them)
 - The goal is to get the other person to be the person to pop the last "pop"
 - For each round, you can choose to pop any amount of "pop"s that's in the same "row"
